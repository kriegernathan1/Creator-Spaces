# Creator Spaces
A platform for content creators looking for an alternative to popular platforms such as Instagram, Youtube, and TikTok. Commonly creators can be forced to alter or outright remove their content from these sites due to reccomendor systems that favor some content over others. Creator spaces looks to resolve this problem by enabling users to easily create their own independent branded "spaces". Said spaces would appear independent from the platform to end users but would be powered by our suite of microservices and configuration driven frontend.
