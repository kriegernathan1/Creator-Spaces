# Creator Spaces
A platform that allows content creators to serve their core audience in their own seemingly independent space.

## Overview
Creator Spaces consists of three main pieces:
 - BaaS
 - Server Driven Frontend
 - Creator Dashboard

### BaaS
A headless backend that contains all the services needed to power a content heavy frontend. Services include:
- User management
- Post management
- Content monetization
-  Moderation
-  Configuration
-  User Support

### Server Driven Frontend
The majority of creators don't want to spend their time building their own website. For this reason, we created an independent frontend that integrates with the BaaS. The frontend is driven completely from the configuration the creator sets enabling them to have a brand-specific space for their audience.

### Creator Dashboard
A powerful dashboard creators will build, maintain, and personalize their space.
